## Description

This project is a web page that performs compressible gasdynamics calculations.
Assumptions are ideal, calorically perfect gases (constant specific heats).

Stagnation property and normal shock wave calculations are performed.

Simple mode requires only the freestream Mach number and the ratio of specific heats, and outputs only the ratios.
Full mode requires the gas properties and outputs the actual post-shock and stagnation properties.

## TODO

- 'full mode' should only require 2 gas properties, of the users choice
- 'full mode' results
